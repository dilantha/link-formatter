# Link Formatter

Formats a block of links into a clean markdown list in Obsidian.

Here I'm pasting links from Firefox bookmarks and formatting them.

First install the [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/BRAT) plugin. 

Then either from the BRAT settings page, or from the command palette, select "Add beta plugin". Paste the plugin URL https://github.com/dilantha/obsidian-link-formatter and then install.

## How to use

Once installed select the links you want to format and search for `Link Formatter: Format links to unordered list` in the command pallet.

Once you select that the links will be formatted. You can also setup a hotkey for this command.
